# jo-CssResets

Default resets with normalize.css. HTML was created for flowing text, so it makes. This library does not set style, like remove button border and background, it only removes style properties that will "hinder development".

HTML was created for plain text, so it makes sense to adapt it so we can work in a more modern way.
